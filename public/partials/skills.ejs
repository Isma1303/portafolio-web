    <p>
      I have experience with programming languages such as C#, JavaScript,
      Python, HTML, CSS, PHP,node.JS, Express.JS, MongoDB and MySQL. Iâ€™ve worked
      on both desktop and web applications, applying principles of
      object-oriented programming and software design. I also have an
      intermediate level of English, which I developed through a National
      Geographic course in high school and continued to improve through
      self-study.
